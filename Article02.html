                    Many organ systems are damaged due to the lack of proper nutrition to the body needs from water. 
                    The condition is also severe enough to interfere with kidney function.As we have often heard, 
                    the formation of kidney stones is also an unfortunate omen of the above process. The risk of developing kidney stones in a lifetime is between 5% and 13% per person.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Data shows that this risk is further increased with obesity and diabetes. According to reports, the male party is at increased risk.

                    Changes in the location of the kidneys, obstruction of the urinary tract, certain hereditary diseases, and living in a high-temperature environment can cause kidney stones.

                    The primary symptom of suspected kidney stones is excessive pain. This extends from the spine to the lower abdomen. In addition, occasional urination, red urine, and vomiting may occur.

                    If you see a doctor when you have any of the above symptoms, urine tests and abdominal x-ray tests are the primary tests. Abdominal x-rays can sometimes make it difficult to identify stones. In such cases ultrasound scans and CT scans are used.
                    If you have frequent kidney stones, a urine sample collected over a period of 24 hours can be used to determine its constituents.

                <p>
                    Also, small stones are often excreted in the urine. They can be sent to a laboratory to identify their constituents. By identifying the components, drugs can be obtained against their recurrence. Often the doctor will prescribe medication to minimize recurrence by identifying the components.

                    Most commonly, kidney stones are made up of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. In addition, stones containing uric acid can be seen.

                <p>
                    As mentioned above, kidney stones are small in size and require no special treatment as they are excreted in the urine.

                    However, if they are large in size, the pain is unbearable, or frequent urinary tract infections cause obstruction of the urinary tract, the stones may be surgically removed or crushed with an external waveguide.
